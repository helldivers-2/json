Primary/Secondary:
    Capacity: For Energy Based Weapons such as LAS-5 Scythe and LAS-16 Sickle, this is the # of seconds they can fire before overheat. 
    In-game this shows as Fire Limit, but easier to just leave it the same for both as to not have a seperate file just for l4z0rz
    Fire Rate: If FireRate is 0, such as for the LAS-5 Scythe, Damage should be interpreted as Damage/S as it's a continuous fire  (beam) weapon.
