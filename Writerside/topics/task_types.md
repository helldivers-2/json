### Keys
The key values of the dictionary will be the value that is assigned in the api. In the file you can see that a key of 
"12" has been assigned to the value "Defense", as that is what is shown in the API.

### Values
The value that is mapped to each key is derived from in-game observation. For example, we have derived that the key "12"
is Defense as when in-game, the Major Order was a Defense MO.
