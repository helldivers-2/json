# Item Names

## dictionary
This json contains a dictionary of key: value pairs, with the keys being itemIds, with the values
being dictionaries containing item Name and mixID.

Only items that have been data-mined / are in-game have been mapped, except for the starting Liberator,
Peacemaker, and G-12 High Explosive, for which we don't have proper itemIds for, so they have been assigned itemIds of 
3, 4, and 2 respectively.

```json
